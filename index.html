                                <img src="img/yvonneThumb.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Yvonne" />
                                Yvonne is most thankful to her parents for the gift of two loving big brothers &amp; five amazing role-model sisters. As the second-youngest, Yvonne spent her childhood twirling &amp; dancing around, putting on talent shows for her parents &amp; grandparents. Her creative spirit and eye for design was established at a young age, as she highly disapproved of Mattel’s © furnishings and décor within her Barbie House. If Barbie needed an interior makeover (which was frequent) Yvonne looked through Sunday newspaper ads &amp; IKEA magazines for inspiration, drew the new contents by hand and placed them as backdrops in the Barbie house. After graduation from Mater Dei High School, Yvonne explored the metropolitan life in San Francisco and graduated with a BS in Interior Design from San Francisco State University. Yvonne is adding to her vows that she will forever allow a one-room “man-den” with it’s contents and décor subject to Nils’s discretion.</p>

                                <img src="img/nilsThumb.jpg" class="thumb" alt="Nils" />
                                Nils is the eldest of the three half-German and half-Vietnamese Schimmelmann siblings. He was born in Los Angeles and raised in San Diego where he developed a love for the outdoors and strived to become a junior ranger at every National Park he visited. At age 9, the Schimmelmann family moved to Indiana and Nils started to consider himself a midwestern boy as he joined the Boy Scouts and spent more time playing in the local forests and creeks. Nils also took an interest in computers, checking out books from the local library to program his own games, and building his own PC to play them. This hobby would later lead to his BS in Computer Science and MS in Bioinformatics and bring him back to California. After graduation, Nils moved back to to the Bay Area to work in Silicon Valley. In the Bay, he expanded his interests to include snowboarding, rock climbing, and weight training at the local gym.

                            <p>
                            Nils and Yvonne met each other through mutual friends at the local gym. Yvonne initially thought Nils was “obnoxious” and did not think much of him until Nils’ birthday party where she learned that he loved snowboarding. This lead to her into trying to entrap him into being her ride-share and cabin-share but not before Nils thought that Yvonne was “extremely negative”. Luckily, these short sighted problems went away and Nils and Yvonne would later go out on many “events” because she did not want to call their relationship “dating”. Fast forward 6 months later, Yvonne finally agreed that they were “dating”.

                            <p>
                            Nils and Yvonne had been dating for nearly 3 years when Nils decided that they should go for a walk in San Francisco on Black Friday to burn off the turkey. They hiked to the Ferry Building, up to the top of the Coit Tower, where Nils then got down on one knee to propose to Yvonne. Yvonne was completely shocked and said “yes”!

                            <h2>HISTORY OF THE INN</h2>
                            <p>
                                Ninety years ago, construction began on La Morada (“dwelling” in Spanish), the first building in what would become Rancho Santa Fe. Now known as The Inn at Rancho Santa Fe, “The Inn” to locals, it was then a guesthouse for prospective land buyers, a place to “put them up” while they looked at lots owned by the Santa Fe Land Improvement Company. The company, a subsidiary of the Santa Fe Railway, had bought up parcels, planting eucalyptus trees for railroad spikes. But as history has so often shown, not everything goes according to plan. The wood, the company discovered, was too soft to hold the spikes. It was on to plan B.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That plan turned out to be fortuitous. It led to the master-planned community of Rancho Santa Fe, designed by Lilian Rice, a National City-born architect and U.C. Berkeley graduate, who would earn acclaim for her signature Spanish Colonial Revival style. Rice designed the village’s key commercial and residential buildings, many now considered so historically significant that they are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Throughout the decades The Inn has been a favorite destination for many years of famous and influential people.  In 1932, singer-actor Bing Crosby purchased one of Juan Osuna’s original adobes with 50 acres, and hired Lilian Rice as his architect. Legendary architect Frank Lloyd Wright was married in the parlor of the Inn in 1928.   
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Just as the architecture of the missions tells a story about the history of California, so does Lilian Rice’s legendary design of The Inn. It is a perfect representation of old California charm and Rice's belief that true beauty lies in simplicity rather than ornateness. The Inn is a perfect reflection of Rice's dream - a place where time stands still amidst the simplistic, natural beauty that is Rancho Santa Fe.  &nbsp;&nbsp;
